# **Section 1: Problem Statement**  
This project analyzes ValueFrenzy, a fictional supermarket chain in the USA, Mexico, and Canada, facing stagnant revenue growth and profitability concerns across regions and product categories. The COO and CFO sought insights into slowing revenue and potential regional inefficiencies or product performance issues.

As the Business Analyst, I examined three years (2021-2023) of sales data, identifying trends affecting revenue, profit, and transaction values. Using Advanced Excel (Power Query, Power Pivot, DAX) and BA techniques (SWOT, Gap Analysis, Stakeholder Interviews, Competitor Benchmarking), I conducted in-depth analysis and created business reports. I developed an interactive dashboard that revealed a 25% drop in Average Transaction Value (ATV) and regional sales disparities.

The ultimate objective was not only to diagnose the root causes of these challenges but also to provide actionable recommendations for revenue recovery and strategies to sustain growth.

# **Section 2: Motivation**  
The Retail and Consumer Goods industry operates in a highly competitive and rapidly evolving market environment. Supermarkets like ValueFrenzy face challenges such as changing customer preferences, fluctuating costs, and competitive pricing pressures. This project was motivated by the need to:

âœ… Understand why ValueFrenzy is experiencing a decline in revenue and profitability in the USA.

âœ… Identify trends in customer spending habits across different regions and product categories.

âœ… Provide data-backed recommendations to improve operational efficiency, pricing strategies, and customer satisfaction.

âœ… Support strategic decision-making through business-driven insights rather than purely numerical analysis.

# **Section 3: Data Sources**
The analysis is based on historical sales data from 2021-2023, available in CSV format. The data includes sales transactions, product categories, and regional performance metrics. To prepare the data for analysis:

âœ… Power Query was used for data cleaning and transformation.

âœ… Power Pivot was utilized to establish relationships between sales data (fact table) and relevant business dimensions (products, regions, and time).

âœ… No SQL queries were required, as all transformations were performed within Excelâ€™s ecosystem.

# **Section 4: Key Performance Indicators & Rationale behind Selected KPIs**

- For this project, I focused on **five Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)** to evaluate ValueFrenzyâ€™s financial and sales performance. **Total Revenue** and **Gross Profit** provided insights into overall earnings and profitability, while **Quantity Sold** and **Total Transactions** helped measure demand and customer activity. Finally, **Average Transaction Value (ATV)** assessed customer spending behavior and pricing effectiveness.
  
- The selection of these KPIs was driven by several factors. First, they aligned with the analysis goals, helping assess business strengths and weaknesses. Second, I prioritized data reliability, ensuring that only complete and high-quality data was used. Some potential metrics, like Return Rate, were excluded due to data gaps.
  
- Additionally, we focused on actionable and clear KPIs to maintain clarity and avoid unnecessary complexity. These metrics also aligned with economic and industry trends, addressing ValueFrenzyâ€™s declining revenue and profitability. While this analysis provided valuable insights, future explorations could incorporate additional metrics such as Customer Retention and Inventory Turnover for a more comprehensive view.

# **Section 5: Key BA Techniques Used**

At the start of the project, I needed to understand ValueFrenzyâ€™s current performance, identify gaps, and uncover strategic opportunities. To achieve this, I applied a structured approach using key business analysis techniques:

- **SWOT Analysis** helped assess ValueFrenzyâ€™s strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats, ensuring that our focus remained on the most critical business priorities.
  
- **Gap Analysis** was used to compare ValueFrenzyâ€™s current (As-Is) state with the desired (To-Be) state. Since we lacked qualitative insights, I leveraged data-driven analysis to identify revenue declines, profitability gaps, and regional performance variations.
  
- **Competitor Benchmarking** provided industry context, helping to evaluate how ValueFrenzy compared to competitors in terms of revenue performance, pricing strategies, and sales trends.
  
- **Process Mapping** played a crucial role in visualizing operational inefficiencies that impacted revenue and ATV. By mapping sales and pricing workflows, I identified areas where process improvements could drive better results.
  
- **Stakeholder Interviews** were conducted with key decision-makers, such as the COO, CFO, and Head of Sales & Marketing, to align the analysis with business objectives. Their inputs helped refine KPI selection and guided the strategic focus.

By combining these techniques, I was able to translate business challenges into data-driven insights, ensuring that the recommendations were both practical and actionable.

# **Section 7: Key Business Insights**
## **Declining Revenue and Gross Profit:**

![Insights - Total Revenue](https://github.com/nitinskunigal/ValueFrenzy-Business-Data-Analytics-Project/blob/main/Insights%20Screenshots/Insights%20-%20Total%20Revenue.png)

![Insights - Gross Profit](https://github.com/nitinskunigal/ValueFrenzy-Business-Data-Analytics-Project/blob/main/Insights%20Screenshots/Insights%20-%20Gross%20Profit.png)

- Total revenue decreased from $13.8M in 2021 to $9.7M in both 2022 and 2023, with gross profit dropping from $8.2M to $5.8M. The drop was drastic for both revenue and profit between Dec-2021 and Jan-2022.
  
- While there were similar contributions from Low and High-tier products between 2021 and 2023, the medium-tier category contributed maximum towards revenue and profit. Also, Mexicoâ€™s contributions are on-par with USAâ€™s contributions and thatâ€™s a huge plus for ValueFrenzy.
  
- The core issue was a decline in high-tier sales, particularly in the USA, driven by economic strain, inflation, and a drop in ATV since Dec-2021. Additionally, weekday profits totaled $14.1M, while weekend profits were lower at $5.7M, indicating a need to boost weekend sales.

## **Drop in the Overall Quantity Sold**

![Insights - Quantity Sold](https://github.com/nitinskunigal/ValueFrenzy-Business-Data-Analytics-Project/blob/main/Insights%20Screenshots/Insights%20-%20Quantity%20Sold.png)

- The total quantity sold is high at 15.7 million units, but there has been a significant decline in the overall quantity sold, especially in low-tier products, from Dec-2021 to Jan-2022. Despite its significant decline, low-tier products (groceries) account for 49% of total sales, indicating they drive volume.
  
- Despite having the highest ATV, high-tier products contributed 17% of total quantity sold, which happens to be the lowest amongst three categories, and needs granular attention. This decline was significant as consumers prioritized essential goods over discretionary items.

## **Disparity Between Transactions and ATV Trends (Octâ€“Dec)**

![Insights - Total Transactions](https://github.com/nitinskunigal/ValueFrenzy-Business-Data-Analytics-Project/blob/main/Insights%20Screenshots/Insights%20-%20Total%20Transactions.png)

![Insights - ATV](https://github.com/nitinskunigal/ValueFrenzy-Business-Data-Analytics-Project/blob/main/Insights%20Screenshots/Insights%20-%20ATV.png)

- Transaction volume remained steady, indicating consistent customer purchases.
  
- However, ATV declined sharply from over $75 in 2021 to around $53 in 2022 and 2023. This suggests more customers were buying lower-value items, resulting in smaller spend per transaction.
  
- The decline in ATV was driven by a shift in customer behavior, with fewer high-value transactions and an increase in low-cost purchases, particularly essentials like groceries. This trend reflects a decrease in customer spending power, influenced by external factors such as inflation.

The insights and root causes show how KPIs are interlinked and affected by economic factors, product tier performance, and regional disparities. The primary focus should be on recovering revenue and profit margins by improving sales in high-margin categories while maintaining steady performance in core product areas like groceries and household goods.


# **Section 8: Business Impact Summary**

Understanding the business impact of our findings was crucial in shaping actionable recommendations.

1. **Revenue Decline & Profitability Challenges:** One of the most significant trends was the decline in both revenue and gross profit post-2021. This pointed to potential pricing inefficiencies and gaps in promotional strategies. While sales continued, margins were shrinking, indicating the need for a more strategic pricing approach.
   
2. **Regional Performance Variances:** Each region displayed unique challenges and opportunities. The USA, our largest market, contributed the most revenue but struggled with profitability. Meanwhile, Mexico maintained steady sales but at lower margins. Interestingly, Canada, despite lower overall sales, had the highest ATV. This indicated an opportunity to leverage premium product strategies in the region.
   
3. **Shifting Customer Behavior:** One of the key behavioral trends was the increase in transaction volume without a corresponding rise in ATV. This suggested that customers were making more frequent but smaller purchases, possibly due to economic constraints or evolving shopping habits. Understanding these shifts was vital for shaping future marketing and pricing strategies.
   
4. **Product Tier Influence:** Revenue was heavily driven by high-tier products, but transaction volumes were primarily fueled by low and mid-tier products. This reinforced the importance of a balanced pricing and inventory strategyâ€”one that maximized high-tier sales while maintaining strong engagement with lower-tier products.
   
5. **Strategic Implications:** Overall, these insights underscored the need for region-specific strategies, dynamic pricing models, and optimized product positioning to enhance revenue and profitability. A one-size-fits-all approach wouldnâ€™t be effectiveâ€”tailored interventions were necessary to drive sustainable business growth.

# **Section 9: Refining Recommendations Through Stakeholder Collaboration**

Refining our recommendations was not just about analyzing numbers; it was an iterative process shaped by collaboration with key stakeholders to ensure feasibility and real-world impact.

- **Initial Insights & Hypotheses:** Initially, our recommendations were purely data-driven, identifying straightforward correlations, like declining revenue indicating a need for price adjustments. However, business decisions are rarely that simple.
  
- **Stakeholder Feedback & Business Context:** To create strategies that were both practical and impactful, we engaged stakeholders across different functions, including the COO, CFO, Sales, and Product Strategy teams. Their insights revealed critical business realities that raw data alone could not capture.
  
- **Refinement & Finalization:** Through data-driven discussions, our initial hypotheses evolved into actionable, high-impact strategies. Every recommendation was aligned with both business priorities and market realities, ensuring a balance between profitability, customer engagement, and operational feasibility.
  
- **Key Takeaway:** Data alone doesnâ€™t drive decisions; collaborating with stakeholders transforms insights into strategic, real-world solutions.

# **Section 10: Finalized Recommendations for Strategic Growth**

With stakeholder feedback incorporated, we finalized a set of focused, high-impact recommendations aimed at reversing revenue decline, optimizing operations, and strengthening ValueFrenzyâ€™s market position.

- **Refining pricing strategies** became a priority, ensuring adjustments were based on regional spending patterns and product-tier performance. Instead of broad price cuts, we proposed targeted promotions and dynamic pricing strategies to maximize revenue without sacrificing margins.
  
- We also identified the need for **product mix optimization**. High-tier products were the primary revenue drivers, but low and mid-tier products fueled transaction volumes. By realigning inventory and matching regional demand trends, we could ensure efficient stock allocation and improved sales performance.
  
- To **boost transaction value**, we recommended personalized promotions and upselling tactics to encourage customers to spend more per visit. This would increase Average Transaction Value (ATV) without relying solely on price increases.
  
- Another key focus was **leveraging customer insights**. Transactional data could be used to personalize marketing campaigns, improving customer engagement and retention while strengthening brand loyalty.
  
- Finally, **operational efficiency and cost control** were critical. By streamlining supply chain operations and managing COGS effectively, we could maintain profitability without compromising on competitive pricing.
