# **Section 1: Project Overview**  
The earlier version of ValueFrenzy project primarily focused on data analysisâ€”uncovering sales trends, transaction patterns, and pricing inefficiencies. But business decisions arenâ€™t just about data; they require strategic alignment, stakeholder insights, and business context. Thatâ€™s why I enhanced this projectâ€”integrating Business Analysis (BA) techniques to drive actionable solutions. This project presents a business analysis of ValueFrenzy, a fictional supermarket chain across the USA, Mexico, and Canada. 

The analysis aims to diagnose critical business challenges, particularly declining revenue and profitability in the USA, while exploring key performance metricsâ€”Total Revenue, Gross Profit, Quantity Sold, Total Transactions, and Average Transaction Value (ATV). The projectâ€™s core objective is to provide actionable insights and strategic recommendations that enhance ValueFrenzy's market positioning, operational efficiency, and customer engagement.

Using historical sales data from 2021 to 2023, the analysis identifies regional trends, product performance, and customer behavior to help ValueFrenzy make data-driven business decisions. By addressing key issues such as profitability erosion, shifts in consumer demand, and regional performance disparities, this project enables ValueFrenzy to refine its business strategy for sustainable growth.

# **Section 2: Motivation**  
The Retail and Consumer Goods industry operates in a highly competitive and rapidly evolving market environment. Supermarkets like ValueFrenzy face challenges such as changing customer preferences, fluctuating costs, and competitive pricing pressures. This project was motivated by the need to:

âœ… Understand why ValueFrenzy is experiencing a decline in revenue and profitability in the USA.

âœ… Identify trends in customer spending habits across different regions and product categories.

âœ… Provide data-backed recommendations to improve operational efficiency, pricing strategies, and customer satisfaction.

âœ… Support strategic decision-making through business-driven insights rather than purely numerical analysis.


# **Section 3: Data Sources**
The analysis is based on historical sales data from 2021-2023, available in CSV format. The data includes sales transactions, product categories, and regional performance metrics. To prepare the data for analysis:

âœ… Power Query was used for data cleaning and transformation.

âœ… Power Pivot was utilized to establish relationships between sales data (fact table) and relevant business dimensions (products, regions, and time).

âœ… No SQL queries were required, as all transformations were performed within Excelâ€™s ecosystem.

## **Insight 3: Disparity Between Transactions and ATV Trends (Octâ€“Dec)**

<ins>Insight<ins>: 

Transaction volume consistently increased from early October to early December across all three years, particularly during the holiday season. However:

âœ” Flat ATV: Despite higher transaction volumes, the Average Transaction Value (ATV) remained stagnant during this period.

âœ” Holiday Decline: A sharp ATV drop from over $75 to around $53 occurred between December 2021 and January 2022, reflecting a sustained lower level in 2022 and 2023.

âœ” Steady Period Trends: ATV showed minimal fluctuations in non-holiday months, indicating a focus on essentials over discretionary spending.

<ins>Root Cause Analysis<ins>: 

âœ” Customer Spending Behavior: Increased transaction volumes were driven by low-tier purchases (groceries), which limited ATV growth.

âœ” Economic Constraints: Inflation and reduced disposable income further suppressed spending on high-tier products.

âœ” Promotional Gap: Seasonal promotions primarily targeted transaction increases, not ATV growth, limiting the opportunity to capitalize on the holiday surge.

## **Recommendation 3: Boost Average Transaction Value (ATV)**

âœ” Upselling and Cross-Selling Strategies:

  - Dynamic Suggestions: Use customer purchase history and cart data to suggest premium or complementary products at checkout. Examples: Electronics - Recommend accessories like chargers or screen protectors. Groceries - Suggest related household products, such as bulk cleaning supplies.

  - Bundled Offers: Create bundles that combine high-tier products with frequently purchased low-tier items, offering slight discounts to encourage bulk spending.

âœ” Holiday-Specific ATV Campaigns:

  - Personalized Offers: Use targeted marketing emails or app notifications to present curated product bundles or discounts on high-value items during the holiday season.

  - Promotional Financing Options: Offer 0% interest financing or flexible payment plans on high-tier purchases to incentivize larger transactions during key shopping periods.

âœ” Monitor and Adjust Campaign Effectiveness:

  - Analyze ATV and transaction data to assess the success of loyalty programs and cross-selling efforts.

  - Use insights to refine offers and adjust strategies for subsequent holiday seasons.

### **Impact of Recommendations**

By incentivizing higher-value purchases and leveraging customer data for targeted upselling, these strategies can:

  - Increase ATV without compromising transaction volumes.

  - Strengthen customer loyalty by offering tangible value through rewards and personalized offers.

  - Align holiday promotions with profitability goals, maximizing the seasonal surge's impact.



## **Insight 4: Impact of Macroeconomic Conditions on Purchasing Patterns**

<ins>Insight<ins>: 

Macroeconomic challenges like inflation, rising operational costs, and shifting customer preferences toward essentials led to fewer high-ticket purchases, particularly electronics. Customers across all regions increasingly opted for value-for-money goods, negatively impacting Average Transaction Value (ATV) and profit margins.

<ins>Root Cause Analysis<ins>: 

âœ” Inflationary Pressures: Rising costs of goods and services reduced disposable income, limiting customers' ability to purchase high-value items like electronics and furniture.

âœ” Operational Challenges: Increased supply chain costs due to global disruptions further escalated pricing challenges, squeezing profit margins.

âœ” Shift in Consumer Preferences: The economic climate prompted a focus on affordable essentials, driving demand for low-cost groceries and private label products.

## **Recommendation 4: Adapt to Macroeconomic Conditions**

âœ” Promote Private Label Brands:

  - Highlight private label products as affordable, high-quality alternatives to national brands.

  - Run targeted marketing campaigns to showcase cost savings and value for money, appealing to budget-conscious customers.

âœ” Improve Operational Efficiency:
